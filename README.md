# Project Work G5

Here you will find the code related to the interface developed with React.

## Sioux Silos
SiouxSilos ltd. is a company that produces industrial storage systems for bulk and liquid materials. He commissions us to design and build an application for monitoring the liquid level and some environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure and level) of an industrial plant built in North Dakota.

The project is aimed at creating a data presentation interface (dashboard) for plant operators and summary presentation for management(this is a plus).
